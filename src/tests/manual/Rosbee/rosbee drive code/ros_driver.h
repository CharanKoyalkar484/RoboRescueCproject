/**
 * Summary:
 * 	- A port is openened. Allowing for serial communication.
 * 	- Serial commands are send to the rosbee.
 * 	- The commands send are $1,x (forward at x speed)
 * 	  and $3,y (rotate y degrees).
 * 	- $999, is send to confirm the command.
 *	- $0, is send to stop the rosbee (shutdown)
