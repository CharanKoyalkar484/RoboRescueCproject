# EnviromentSimulator Test

Checkpoint
•	Test of a checkpoint gets set right and make sure the getter corresponds with the set checkpoint.
Map:
•	Make a map object out of a file with the constructor. Test the height width and content
•	Make a map object with given height and width with the constructor. Test the height width and content
•	Check if you can set the map content with an new vector. Test what happens if the vector is too small or exceeds the height and width of the map object.
•	Check if you can set an object on the map, check if it corresponds with the get object. Test what happens if you set an object outside the map boundary’s.
•	Save the map and check if the contents of the map correspond to the content of the saved file.
SimulateMap:
•	Test if checkpoint is correctly set.
•	Test what happens when a scan point is set incorrectly
•	Test what happens when a checkpoint is set incorrectly
•	Test what happens if you simulate without scan point
•	Test what happens if you run getPointCloud before simulate
