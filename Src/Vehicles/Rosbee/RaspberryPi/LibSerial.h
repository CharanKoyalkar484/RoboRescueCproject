  \brief
    The class LibSerial offers simple access to the serial port devices for Linux.
    It can be used for any serial device (Built-in serial port, USB to RS232 converter,
    Arduino board, Raspberry Pi or any hardware using or emulating a serial port)
    The class allows basic operations like :
    - opening and closing connection
    - reading data (characters, strings or arrays of bytes)
    - writing data (characters, strings or arrays of bytes)
    - peeking data and flushing the receive buffer
