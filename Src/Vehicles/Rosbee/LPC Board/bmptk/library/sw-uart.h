//! initialize the UART 
//
//! Call this function to initialize the UART pins.

//! write a single character
//
//! This function writes a single character using the standard UART
//! output pin of the chip (GP1_7) and the baudrate BMPTK_BAUDRATE,
//! which is passed as a command line argument during compilation.
void uart_put_char( char c );

//! write a character string
//
//! This function writes the characters of a standard 0-terminated string
//! using uart_put_char().

//! writes an integer in decimal format without leading zero's.
//
//! This function writes an integer in decimal format, without
//! any leading zero's, using using uart_put_char().
//! A negative value will have a '-' in front of it.
//! Writing INT_MIN will not work as expected.

//! writes an unsigend integer as n hexadecimal digits
//
//! This function writes an unsigend integer as n hexadecimal (0-F) digits.
//! Digits higher than n will be ignored.
