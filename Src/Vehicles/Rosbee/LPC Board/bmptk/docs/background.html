<div class="textblock"><p>Around 1995 I got interested in microcontrollers, more specifically in the Microchip 16C84, then the only easily-available microcontroller that could be re-programmed electronically. The 16C84 is primitive and expensive at todays standards, but for me it opened a whole new world. There were some hurdles. You could either buy an expensive programmer, or build your own (unreliable) serial-port controlled programmer. And toolchains were expensive, except the free but assembler-only MPLAB.</p>
<p>No problem, I love tinkering! I built my own intelligent serial-port PIC programmer, based on (of course) a 16C84, programmed in assembler. I still sell the grandchild of that design in my webshop. In the process I also tried to make a library of reuseable PIC assembler code, but that got nowehere. I tried to make macro's for high-level language constructs, including assembly-time memory management and unused code removal. My macro efforts soon became too much for the assembler, it ran out of macro space). So in order to write re-useable code (and for a few other reasons) I switched to writing my own compiler. This resulted in the Jal language and compiler. After a few years I lacked the time to develop jal further. I released the sources, and Kyle York picked it up and rewrote it to the current Jal. It has a small but very dedicated group of followers, including a group that has created an extensive library.</p>
<p>In 2004 I complemented my webshop activities with a part-time assignment as lecturer at the Hogeschool Utrecht. This got me into teaching ARM microcontroller programming, first in assembler and C, later also in C++. Compared to the cramped and bizarre PIC architecture this was almost heaven. Alas, the tools we used (especially the debugger interface) were not heavenly to used, and this took a lot of attention away from (from me and from teh students) away from the primary subject, being the programming itself. To solve this problem I wrote a hughe Python script (mkt.py) that hid all the complexity. It provided taylored chip header files and libraries, did the compiling and linking, and started the simulator, debugger or download tool to run the application. The tool (mkt.py) did its job quite well, but no-one besides me understood what it did and why. A college critized me for this, and when I got the chance to teach some extra lecturers I decided to include the makefile technique into the course, and to rewrite my tool as a makefile and some small scripts. This enabled the students could understand what is going in the environment they have to use, and I had something to talk about in the lessons.</p>
<p>The first course I used it for (C++ and Software Engineering) is a companion to a NintendoDS project. Hence the first target is the NintendoDS (and windows, beacuse that was easy to add), and the first library functionality is drawing grahics. </p>
